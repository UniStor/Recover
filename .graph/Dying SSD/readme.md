Quote:
First of all DDrescue does not work properly with SSD's. It can't deal with failing blocks on SSD's since the Flash Translation layer will always change their topography.
Second, your SSD is physically failed, meaning the controller is failed(or in a panic state), so you can't do anything yourself to recover the data.
